			Heaven has released a disease onto the deer, that slowly turns them into seraphs.\n
			We cannot afford to kill all the deer. Satan likes their meat too much.\n

			Identify the angels and cut their existence short.

			You and all the other hunters have about 3 minutes of breathing the air\n
			That's why we work in turns. Enough talking, there's cleansing to be done.
